This project is a simple frontend Hackathon Portal built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes two main pages: a Landing Page and a Login/Dashboard page. The landing page displays the hackathon name, a brief description, available tracks, and the event timeline, along with a login button for navigation. The login page contains  email and password fields with basic JavaScript validation and displays a welcome message upon successful input. The design follows a clean and professional layout with consistent colors, readable fonts, and a responsive structure suitable for different screen sizes. CSS is used to enhance visual appeal and ensure uniform styling across pages. This project demonstrates fundamental frontend skills, including page navigation, form handling, and responsive UI design.
